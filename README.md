# Half-adder-using-Mixed-signals
<p> The literature survey is on half adder using mixed signals. The proposed circuit design includes both analog and digital circuits. Zero crossing detector (ZCD) is used to generate the square waves, which is fetched to 2-bit counter. These 2-bit numbers get added with the adder circuit. Adder circuit again consist of mixed signal i.e. Complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS NAND gate (analog) with NOT gate (digital) for CARRY and EX-OR gate (digital) for SUM.</p>
